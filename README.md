# Streaming Schedule Script

This RMarkdown file is a rough initial step in streamlining the workflow in operating
Techlahoma Streaming Events. Ideally each step would be fully automated and those efforts
are underway. Until then, this presents crafted fields for populating the various fields
documented within the
[streaming instructions](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/Streaming/Streaming-Instructions.md).

Currently it is hosted at [shinyapps.io](https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/) and deployed via `rsconnect::deployDoc("streamingtextstrings.Rmd")` It can easily be hosted on any [Shiny server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/).
